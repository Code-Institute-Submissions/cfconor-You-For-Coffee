                        <p>
                            A cup is made with only 2 base ingredients - water and coffee, so
                            getting these right is crucial. There are over 800 testing notes and
                            potential flavourings to be found in coffee beans, so you have the
                            opportunity to source coffee based on what you might be interested
                            in. A fresh roast will always provide good results, so its
                            recommended to buy your coffee as fresh as possible, and store in an
                            air-tight container, ready for when you need it. Some good examples
                            of great coffee vendors can be found <a href="vendors.html">here</a>.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Water temperature and ingredients can also have a huge impact on the
                            final product. The amount of minerals and chemicals can vary from
                            country to country, and the less in your water, the better. Using a
                            water filter to try to remove as much of these elements as possible
                            is key to a good cup.

                        <p>
                            A critical aspect of coffee is the chemical reaction when water
                            mixes with the ground coffee. The key to getting this right is water
                            temperature, and a common mistake is to pour boiling water into your
                            coffee. The boiled water will cause the delicate coffee grounds to
                            lose much of their flavour, and become bitter, which is not what we
                            want to achieve. On the other hand, if the water is too cold, we
                            can’t extract as much of the flavour as we’d like from the bean, so
                            there is a bit of skill involved in getting the temperature just
                            right.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Ideally, we’d like to have our water around 95-96 degrees celsius
                            (205 degrees fahrenheit). If you don’t have a high-tech kettle with
                            specific temperature settings, then a good rule of thumb is to wait
                            30 seconds after boiling before you pour your water.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="media mt-5">
                    <div class="media-body col-8">
                        <h5 class="mt-0">Step 3 - Pour in Your Water</h5>
                        <p>
                            This method assumes that you are using a coffee press and you have a
                            spoonful of grinds already added. Steadily pour your water evenly
                            over the ground coffee to agitate the broken down beans, causing
                            them to release the rich flavours and extract it to the hot water.
                            Once your water has been added, it's good to give a short stir to
                            the mix, to ensure that any grounds are mixed into the water and can
                            add their flavour.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At this point you should set a timer for around 2 minutes and 30
                            seconds. Patience is key, we are almost done!
                        </p>

                            The hard parts are all complete. Now you just need to use the
                            plunger to compress the grinds to the bottom of the cup. Just push
                            down till all the beans are pressed into the bottom, or the plunger
                            can go no further, and then pour your delicious coffee into the cup.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note that it can be useful to preheat the coffee cup with some hot
                            water from your kettle, just to ensure that it doesn’t instantly
                            cool the liquid straight away. The flavour of coffee changes
                            slightly as the temperature drops, and you will often find slight
                            differences in flavour from your first sip, to when it has reached a
                            more lukewarm state.
