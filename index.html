                <p>
                    A cup is made with only 2 base ingredients - water and coffee, so
                    getting these right is crucial. There are over 800 testing notes and
                    potential flavourings to be found in coffee beans, so you have the
                    opportunity to source coffee based on what you might be interested
                    in. A fresh roast will always provide good results, so its
                    recommended to buy your coffee as fresh as possible, and store in an
                    air-tight container, ready for when you need it. Some good examples
                    of great coffee vendors can be found <a href="#">here</a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Water temperature and ingredients can also have a huge impact on the
                    final product. The amount of minerals and chemicals can vary from
                    country to country, and the less in your water, the better. Using a
                    water filter to try to remove as much of these elements as possible
                    is key to a good cup.

                <h5 class="mt-0">Step 2 - Heat your Water</h5>
                <p>
                    A critical aspect of coffee is the chemical reaction when water
                    mixes with the ground coffee. The key to getting this right is water
                    temperature, and a common mistake is to pour boiling water into your
                    coffee. The boiled water will cause the delicate coffee grounds to
                    lose much of their flavour, and become bitter, which is not what we
                    want to achieve. On the other hand, if the water is too cold, we
                    can’t extract as much of the flavour as we’d like from the bean, so
                    there is a bit of skill involved in getting the temperature just
                    right.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ideally, we’d like to have our water around 95-96 degrees celsius
                    (205 degrees fahrenheit). If you don’t have a high-tech kettle with
                    specific temperature settings, then a good rule of thumb is to wait
                    30 seconds after boiling before you pour your water.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="media mt-5">
            <div class="media-body col-8">
                <h5 class="mt-0">Step 3 - Pour in Your Water</h5>
                <p>
                    This method assumes that you are using a coffee press and you have a
                    spoonful of grinds already added. Steadily pour your water evenly
                    over the ground coffee to agitate the broken down beans, causing
                    them to release the rich flavours and extract it to the hot water.
                    Once your water has been added, it's good to give a short stir to
                    the mix, to ensure that any grounds are mixed into the water and can
                    add their flavour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At this point you should set a timer for around 2 minutes and 30
                    seconds. Patience is key, we are almost done!
                </p>

                <h5 class="mt-0">Step 4 - Plunge, Pour and Enjoy!</h5>
                <p>
                    The hard parts are all complete. Now you just need to use the
                    plunger to compress the grinds to the bottom of the cup. Just push
                    down till all the beans are pressed into the bottom, or the plunger
                    can go no further, and then pour your delicious coffee into the cup.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that it can be useful to preheat the coffee cup with some hot
                    water from your kettle, just to ensure that it doesn’t instantly
                    cool the liquid straight away. The flavour of coffee changes
                    slightly as the temperature drops, and you will often find slight
                    differences in flavour from your first sip, to when it has reached a
                    more lukewarm state.
