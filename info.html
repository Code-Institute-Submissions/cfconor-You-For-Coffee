                    The history of coffee dates back to the 15th century, and possibly
                    earlier with a number of reports and legends surrounding its first
                    use. The earliest substantiated evidence of either coffee drinking
                    or knowledge of the coffee tree is from the early 15th century, in
                    the Sufi monasteries of Yemen, spreading soon to Mecca and Medina.
                    By the 16th century, it had reached the rest of the Middle East,
                    South India (Karnataka), Persia, Turkey, the Horn of Africa, and
                    northern Africa. Coffee then spread to the Balkans, Italy, and to
                    the rest of Europe, as well as Southeast Asia and despite the bans
                    imposed during the 15th century by religious leaders in Mecca and
                    Cairo, and later by the Catholic Church.

                    One in three Irish people now buys a coffee at least once a day. Not
                    so long ago, you couldn’t get a good cup of coffee in Ireland. Tea
                    was king and coffee was often an afterthought. But over the last
                    decade or so, independent coffee shops and roasters sprang up in
                    great numbers. Walk around the major cities and towns, and you’ll be
                    hard pressed not to stumble upon a bustling coffee shop packed with
                    people working on their laptops.

                    <p>
                        Have a cup of black coffee about an hour before workout and your
                        performance can improve by 11-12%. Caffeine increases adrenaline
                        levels in your blood. Adrenaline is your body’s “fight or flight”
                        hormone which helps you to prepare for physical exertion.
                    </p>
                    <h4>May help you lose weight</h4>
                    <p>
                        Coffee contains magnesium and potassium, which helps the human
                        body use insulin, regulating blood sugar levels and reducing your
                        craving for sugary treats and snacks.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Helps you burn fat</h4>
                    <p>
                        Caffeine helps fat cells break down body fat and use it as fuel
                        for training.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Helps you focus and stay alert</h4>
                    <p>
                        Moderate caffeine intake, 1-6 cups a day, helps you focus and
                        improves your mental alertness.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Protects your body</h4>
                    <p>
                        Coffee contains a lot of antioxidants, that work as little
                        warriors fighting and protecting against free radicals within your
                        body.
